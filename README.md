# Liquidity Calculation and Visualization

This repository contains code for calculating and visualizing liquidity levels in trading data using converted pine Script into  Python Script. The goal is to provide insights into buy and sell liquidity levels within the market data.

## Python Code Explanation

### 1. Fetch OHLCV Data

The Python code fetches OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data from the Binance exchange using the CCXT library.

### 2. Calculate Liquidity Levels

The `calculate_liquidity_levels` function calculates liquidity levels:

   a. Loop through each bar of OHLCV data.
   
   b. Calculate the high and low prices for the current bar.
   
   c. Determine if the current high price is above a threshold calculated from the moving average of the past `liqLen` bars. If yes, consider the high price as a potential buy-side liquidity level.
   
   d. Similarly, check if the current low price is below a threshold calculated from the moving average of the past `liqLen` bars. If yes, consider the low price as a potential sell-side liquidity level.

### 3. DataFrame Creation

The code creates a DataFrame containing the liquidity levels, categorized into buyside and sellside levels.

### 4. Plotting 
*(This is Optional and is not needed)*

The code uses Matplotlib to visualize the liquidity levels on a plot. The plot displays buyside start and break levels, as well as sellside start and break levels.

## Pine Script Strategy Explanation

### 1. Volume at Price (Volume Profile)

The Pine Script strategy calculates liquidity levels based on the "volume at price" or "Volume Profile" concept.

### 2. Define getVolumePrice Function

A custom function called `getVolumePrice` is defined. It calculates the total volume at a specific price level within a given lookback period. It iterates through bars and sums up the volume for bars where the price level falls within the high and low range.

### 3. Calculate Liquidity Levels

In the main loop, liquidity levels are calculated using the `getVolumePrice` function. It sums up the volume at price levels that are a certain distance from the current closing price, both for buyside and sellside.

## Improvement Suggestions for Python Code

1. Incorporate Volume Information: Consider incorporating volume data into the calculation to provide insights into where actual trading activity is occurring.

2. Refine Liquidity Level Calculation: Experiment with different calculations that take into account more advanced indicators or techniques used by traders to identify liquidity.

3. Timeframe-based Aggregation: Aggregate the data into different timeframes to capture liquidity changes over time and provide more granular insights.

4. Backtesting: Implement a backtesting framework to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of your liquidity level identification strategy over historical data.

5. Dynamic Thresholds: Consider dynamic thresholds based on volatility or other market conditions instead of fixed threshold values for buy and sell liquidity levels.

## Usage

To use the Python code, follow the instructions provided in the code comments. Run the code to calculate and visualize liquidity levels in the trading data.

For the Pine Script strategy, you can use it within TradingView by creating a new strategy and copying the code into the Pine Script editor.

Feel free to customize and experiment with the code to suit your trading strategy and goals.
